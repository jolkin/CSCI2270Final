# CSCI2400Final
Final Project for CSCI 2400 Data Structures

Project Summary:
A maze based game, which is organized like a Binary Search Tree.  Your goal is to get to the bottom of the tree.  Beating a room (a puzzle or something) will put you down the right branch, and losing a room will put you down the left branch.  If you travel down the let twice, the bst reshuffles and you are returned to a new root.
